## **Interests**

**What I'm Into**

I'm always curious about the world around me, especially:

- **Mind and Soul:** Philosophy, psychology, and spirituality.
- **The Weird and Wonderful:** Surrealism, mystery, and all things strange.
- **Tech and Art:** How technology can enhance creativity.

I use these interests as a starting point for my projects. Whether I'm creating digital art or writing a blog post, I aim to spark curiosity and inspire others.
