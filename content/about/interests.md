## **Interests**

### **What My Work Explores**

- **Mind & Soul:** Delving into philosophy, psychology, and transcendence to understand the deeper facets of human experience.
- **The Unusual & Enigmatic:** Embracing magical realism, mystery, and concepts that challenge conventional viewpoints.
- **Art, Tech & Music:** Inspired by surreal art, immersive trance music, and the creativity of indie gaming.

My projects are infused with these themes, guiding my approach to digital art, writing, and more. My goal is to create work that sparks insight and invites fresh perspectives.
