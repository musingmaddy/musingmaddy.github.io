## **Interests**

### **What My Work Explores**

- **Mind & Soul:** philosophy, psychology, and human transcendence to understand the deeper facets of human experience.
- **The Unusual & Enigmatic:** magical realism, mystery, and ideas that challenge conventional viewpoints.
- **Art, Tech & Music:** surreal art, immersive trance music, and the creativity of indie gaming.

My projects are infused with these themes, guiding my approach to my digital art, writing, and more. My goal is to create work that sparks insight and invites fresh perspectives.
