   *The Legend Of Jeev Atman* is an upcoming adventure novel in progress that weaves elements of mystery, philosophy, and spiritual growth. Through its characters and storyline, this work explores the questions about life, identity, self discovery and human transcendence. Writing this fiction novel is an ongoing journey, blending storytelling with themes that resonate deeply with my creative vision.
