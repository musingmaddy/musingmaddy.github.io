## **My Projects**

1. **AI Art Collection**  
   My AI Art Project is a vibrant collection of digital artworks. I update this gallery regularly, showcasing the unexpected beauty and uniqueness of thematic art. 

2. **Fiction Novel: *Jeev Atman***  
   *Jeev Atman* is an upcoming adventure novel in progress that weaves elements of mystery, philosophy, and spiritual growth. Through its characters and storyline, I aim to explore questions about life, self-discovery, and the intersection of humanity and technology. Writing this novel is an ongoing journey, blending my love for storytelling with themes that resonate deeply with my creative vision.

3. **Indie Game Development**  
   Alongside *Jeev Atman*, I’m developing an indie game in Unity as a digital adaptation of the novel. This project allows me to bring the world of *Jeev Atman* to life interactively, inviting players to experience its story and universe in a completely new way. It’s an immersive blend of art, storytelling, and gameplay, all grounded in the philosophy of “Inspiring New Perspectives Through Creativity & AI.”
