>From the abyssal depths of the cosmos, a scene of profound desolation and cosmic horror unfolds. The derelict spaceship "Vanguard," a monument to a forgotten age, hangs in the void like a spectral sentinel. Its once-proud hull is now a canvas of decay, marked by rusted scars and gaping wounds that narrate a dreadful saga of abandonment and despair. The ship's name, "Vanguard," and the number "21" are etched in long-fa ded paint, remnants of a time when the vessel was a beacon of hope, now a ghostly whisper in the cosmic wind.

>From the abyssal depths of the cosmos, a scene of profound desolation and cosmic horror unfolds. The derelict spaceship "Vanguard," a monument to a forgotten age, hangs in the void like a spectral sentinel. Its once-proud hull is now a canvas of decay, marked by rusted scars and gaping wounds that narrate a saga of abandonment and despair. The ship's name, "Vanguard," and the number "21" are etched in long-faded paint, remnants of a time when the vessel was a beacon of hope, now a ghostly whisper in the cosmic wind.

>The ship's interior, laid bare by a catastrophic breach, is a grotesque tableau of twisted metal and dangling wires, a macabre dance of destruction frozen in time. Flickering lights, fueled by a mysterious, resilient source, cast eerie shadows that writhe and twist, adding a sinister rhythm to the silence of the void. Melted metals and exposed wiring tell a silent tale of a cataclysm, while the pervasive rust speaks volumes of the ship's abandonment.

>In the backdrop, a shattered planet looms, a celestial body fractured by a cataclysmic asteroid strike. Its fragmented remains, a jigsaw puzzle of destruction, are scattered across the cosmic canvas, creating a haunting panorama of a world torn asunder. The planet's jagged edges, silhouetted against the backdrop of the cosmos, cast long, ominous shadows that stretch across the void, adding depth and drama to this scene of cosmic ruin.

>The celestial surroundings are a breathtaking spectacle of swirling nebulae, distant galaxies, and the faint, ethereal glow of cosmic dust. This is a scene that encapsulates the universe's raw, untamed beauty and its chilling indifference to the trials of those within it. The artistic influences of Zdzisław Beksiński and H.R. Giger are evident, their signature dark, surrealistic styles infusing the scene with a grotesque elegance. No land or mountains are visible, only the infinite expanse of space and the fragmented remnants of a shattered world.

>Intricate, hyper-detailed, hyper-realistic, hyper-complex. Vivid colors, Unreal Engine 5, Octane render, 3D render, raytracing, photorealistic, volumetric fog, volumetric lighting, global illumination. Dark, horror, ominous, cosmic, vast, and desolate.
